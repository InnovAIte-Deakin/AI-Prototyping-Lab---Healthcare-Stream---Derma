# Project Status & Roadmap Summary

## Objective
Convert the current DermaAI prototype into a professional-grade teledermatology web application. The goal is to provide a seamless user journey from an anonymous visitor to a patient receiving AI analysis, and finally to a doctor consultation, all within a unified interface.

## Key Themes
1.  **Professionalism**: Moving from raw JSON and basic forms to proper UI cards, landing pages, and navigation.
2.  **Continuity**: Bridging the gap between "AI Chat" and "Doctor Chat". The AI starts the triage, the Doctor finishes the care.
3.  **Accessibility**: Removing barriers (forced login) to demonstrates value early via "Try Now" features.

## High-Level Roadmap

### Phase 1: UX Foundation (Sprint 1)
*   **Logout & Navigation**: Fix basic app lifecycle issues.
*   **Landing Page**: Create a proper "Clinic" front door.
*   **Human-Readable AI**: Convert JSON results into a readable card + Chat interface.

### Phase 2: Clinical Integration (Sprint 2)
*   **Doctor Escalation**: Connect the AI case to a real doctor.
*   **Anonymous Try-Out**: Allow unregistered usage with conversion funnels.
*   **Security**: Hardening authentication with JWT.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
*   Local AI models.
*   Nurse triage workflows.
